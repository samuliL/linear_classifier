# linear_classifier

An implementation of a simple linear classifier. Source: Introduction to Deep Learning on Coursera, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf.

The classifier is initialized with a set of data points and their correct classes. The classifier is trained with the data using stochastic mini batch gradient descent with the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) heuristic. The code also includes a class that generates random data points for testing the classifier.
